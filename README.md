# Physics

## Formules

### Forces 
* Accelaration  
  `Acc = force / mass`

* Friction (simplified)  
  `Friction = -1 * direction * constant`

* Drag force (simplified)  
  `Drag = -1 * constant * ||obj.velocity||^2 * direction`

* Gravitational Attraction (simplified)  
  `GA = ((G * obj1.mass * obj2.mass) / distance^2) * direction`

* Steering  
  `Steering = (desire.direction * maxSpeed) - (direction * maxSteer)`

### Vectors
* Magnitude  
  `Magnitude^2 = vector.x^2 + vector.y^2`

# Genetic Algorithm

## Darwinian Natural Selection

* **Heredity**  
  There must be proccess in place by which children receive the properties of their parents

* **Varietion**  
  There must be a variety of traits present in the population or a mean with which to intreduce variation

* **Selection**  
  There must be a mechanism by which some members of the population have the opportunity to be parents and pass down therir genetic information and some do not. This is typically referred to as "survival of the fittst"
